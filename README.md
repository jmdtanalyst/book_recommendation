## About the Project

The Book Recommendation System leverages machine learning to suggest books similar to a given title. It uses content-based recommendation techniques, specifically cosine similarity, to quantify the similarity between books based on their descriptions and other metadata.

### Key Features
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Uses cosine similarity to find books similar to the input title.
- **Scikit-learn Integration**: Utilizes Scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` and `cosine_similarity` functions.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple input-output model for ease of use.

### The dashboard and recommedation can be accessed on:  oci.jmcloudpro.com:8052
